The VisualTimeAnomaly code is comming soon (within 3 weeks)!

## 🏆 Contributions:
- The first comprehensive benchmark for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), covering diverse scenarios (univariate, multivariate, irregular) and varying anomaly granularities (point-, range-, variate-wise).
- Several critical insights significantly advance the understanding of both MLLMs and TSAD.
- We construct a large-scale dataset including 12.4k time series images, and release the dateset and code to foster future research.
