## 🏆 Contributions:
- The first comprehensive benchmark for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), covering diverse scenarios (univariate, multivariate, irregular) and varying anomaly granularities (point-, range-, variate-wise).
- Several critical insights significantly advance the understanding of both MLLMs and TSAD.
- We construct a large-scale dataset including 12.4k time series images, and release the dateset and code to foster future research.

## 🔎 Findings:
- MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies;
- MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing;
- Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series.
